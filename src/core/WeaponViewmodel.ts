// naive single-pass render (the weapon mesh parented directly into the main
// scene/camera) would clip through nearby walls, since it would share the
// main scene's depth buffer -- a wall 0.3 units away is closer to the
// camera than the far side of a viewmodel gun. Instead this owns a wholly
// separate THREE.Scene/THREE.PerspectiveCamera pair, rendered as a second
// pass after the main scene with a freshly cleared depth buffer (see
// render()) and a very close near-plane, so the depth test the second pass
// runs is only ever against this file's own (trivial) geometry.
//
// Rendering-only: this class has no notion of "alive"/"dead" or any other
// gameplay state. main.ts (the composition root) decides when to call
// render() based on gameState.playerState, the same way it already gates
// gameMode.update() -- keeping this file free of a GameState import.
