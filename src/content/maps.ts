// test-grid: interior pillar at row 4, col 2 doubles as a line-of-sight
// blocker for testing InteractSystem: it originally sat directly between the
// spawn point and the checkpoint-3 placeholder interactable box (deleted at
// checkpoint 11). The row-2 partition
// (checkpoint 6) walls off the row-1 alcove behind door_1, opened by
// button_1 (row 3, next to the gap but not inside it, so it doesn't block
// the doorway itself).
//
// corridors (checkpoint 9.5): two full-sized rooms (west "Room A", cols
// 1-3; east "Room B", cols 7-9) connected by a single-file, 3-cell-long
// corridor (row 4, cols 4-6) — genuinely more corridor structure than
// test-grid's single 1-cell gap, and door_1 at the corridor's middle cell
// fully seals the only path between the two rooms, since the corridor is
// exactly one row tall (rows 3 and 5 at cols 4-6 are walls, so there's no
// way around it).
